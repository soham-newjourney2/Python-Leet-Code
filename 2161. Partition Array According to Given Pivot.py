# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer pivot. Rearrange nums such that the following conditions are satisfied:
# Every element less than pivot appears before every element greater than pivot.
# Every element equal to pivot appears in between the elements less than and greater than pivot.
# The relative order of the elements less than pivot and the elements greater than pivot is maintained.
# More formally, consider every pi, pj where pi is the new position of the ith element and pj is the new position of the jth element. If i < j and both elements are smaller (or larger) than pivot, then pi < pj.
# Return nums after the rearrangement.
