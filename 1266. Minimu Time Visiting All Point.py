# On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.
# You can move according to these rules:
# In 1 second, you can either:
# move vertically by one unit,
# move horizontally by one unit, o
# move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in 1 second).
# You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
# You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.
